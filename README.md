# 🎲 DiceGame

**"When life gives you lemons... roll dice instead!"**  
A digital sanctuary where overworked humans come to gamble virtual dice and forget their real-life responsibilities. 

⚠️ **Disclaimer**: No actual money was harmed in the making of this game... yet. Currently in "lonely gambler" mode (singleplayer only), but multiplayer coming soon™ (if I don't get distracted by shiny objects).

## 🎮 Game Rules (AKA How to Lose Gracefully)

### 🎲 Core Farkle Mechanics
1. **Basic Throwdown**:
   - Roll dice to create scoring combinations
   - Each successful combo builds your point streak
   - Continue rolling to risk your points or cash out
   - Beat the AI's score (when it's not having an existential crisis)

2. **Dice Properties**:
   - Standard dice (6 sides, fair odds)
   - **Blue Lucky Dice** (Higher chance for combo numbers)
   - **Black Cursed Dice** (Deceptive! Lower odds for good numbers)
   - **Golden RoyalDice** (Double points when you roll 1 - ironic, right?)
  
3. **Scoring Combos**:
   | Combination | Points |
   |-------------|--------|
   | 1 |  100 |
   | 5 | 50 |
   | 1 2 3 4 5 6 | 1500 points |
   | 1 1 1 | 1000 |
   | 2 2 2(and oter just make <1000) | 200 |
   
   **find some more)**
     
5. **AI Personality**: 
   Our opponent is basically a moody teenager - sometimes it's Albert Einstein, other times it's a potato with delusions of grandeur.
